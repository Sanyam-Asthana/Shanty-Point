                lyrics: `There once was a ship that put to sea,
The name of the ship was the Billy o' Tea,
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down,
Blow, my bully boys, blow (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.

She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore.
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her.
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her,
When she dived down below (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.

No line was cut, no whale was freed,
The captain's mind was not of greed,
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
She took that ship in tow (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.

For forty days or even more,
The great right whale her carcass tore
And all the men and boys aboard
Ate nothing but raw (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.

Ah, but better things are yet to come,
When we've eaten all the whale and drunk all the rum.
We'll sail away and leave the shore,
And then we'll sing no more (huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum.
One day, when the tonguing is done,
We'll take our leave and go.`

"Leave her, Johnny, leave her."
Tomorrow you will get your pay,
and it's time for us to leave her.

Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.

Oh, the wind was foul and the sea ran high.
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!"
She shipped it green and none went by.
And it's time for us to leave her.

Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.

I hate to sail on this rotten tub.
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!"
No grog allowed and rotten grub.
And it's time for us to leave her.

Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.

We swear by rote for want of more.
"Leave her, Johnny, leave her!"
But now we're through so we'll go on shore.
And it's time for us to leave her.

Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.`
